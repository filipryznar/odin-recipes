    <h2>Let`s get cooking Miso Ramen!</h2>
    <p><strong>No, this isn't instant ramen so don’t ask. I'm talking about the gourmet ramen that costs $15 or more for a single bowl! That's just unacceptable so I'll show you how to make homemade gourmet miso ramen for just 3 dollars that'll make all categories of ramen from fancy to instant look bad.</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
